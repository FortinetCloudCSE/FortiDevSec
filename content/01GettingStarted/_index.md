## LAB 1 - Get (git) Ready
This lab will take you through the process of creating a User Token for Github and then a few other administrative tasks to prepare the environment.  More advanced users, already familiar with Github, can just use the link from Task 2 below to fork the repository and then move on to LAB 2.
