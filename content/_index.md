### Welcome!

This site, hosted on GitHub Pages, will explain how to use the [Hugo Web Framework]("https://gohugo.io/") & the ["reLearn" Theme]("https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/index.html") to effectively organize & deliver Fortinet TEC Workshops & Product demos in a consistent, simple, and visually appealing format.

The beauty of this framework lies in its simplicity.  Within approx 30 mins, anybody can have a site up and running.  Content is created via Markdown files, and the workshop guide layout is simply a directory structure.

Follow along on this simple tutorial to get up and running with a Hugo formatted site for your TEC Workshop/training/demo content today!

### Learning Objectives
- Setup hugo on your system and clone this repo for re-usable starting point
- Customize the Hugo content folder to display proper information flow for your TEC Workshop/demo/training
- Publish your Hugo site to GitHub pages via a CI/CD model (GitHub action will automatically re-build your Hugo content whenever you push to the underlying repo)
